# **Assignment 1:** Basic Agent Based Model

**Module:** GEOG5990M Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills

**Student ID:** 201534083


## Model summary

The model presented here is the result of the practical work of the module, with additional enhancements.

This basic model emulates grazing behaviour of agents in an environment. Grazers (agents) move in and eat from the environment, and share grazed resources with other neighbouring agents.

In general, the model:
- builds agents and initializes them in a space;
- gets them to interact with each other by assesing distances between each other and sharing grazed resources;
- reads in environmental data;
- gets agents to interact with the environment;
- randomizes the order of agent actions;
- displays the model as an animation;
- is contained within a GUI;
- is initialised with data from the web.

## Program components

The program requires to scripts to run:
- [ABM_model.py](https://pages.github.com/), which is the main script from which the program is executed, and;
- [agentframework](https://pages.github.com/), which is the definition of the Agent class.

Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```
