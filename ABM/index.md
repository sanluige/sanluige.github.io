# **Assignment 1:** Basic Agent Based Model

**Module:** GEOG5990M Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills

## Model summary

The model presented here is the result of the practical work of the module, with additional enhancements.

This model emulates basic behaviour of grazers and predators in an environment. Grazers move in and eat from the environment and share grazed resources with other neighbouring grazers. Predators move in a circuit and hunt nearby grazers with probability to fail.

In general, the model:
- builds agents and initializes them in a space;
- gets them to interact with each other by assessing distances between each other and sharing grazed resources;
- reads in environmental data;
- gets agents to interact with the environment;
- randomizes the order of agent actions;
- displays the model as an animation;
- is contained within a GUI;
- is initialised with data from the web.

### Specific enhancements to the base model:
Addition of predators: I added a Predator class that emulates the behaviour of hunting wolves. To do so, I segmented the agent framework script to differentiate subclasses Grazer and Predator, both inheriting common behaviour from the Agent Class.
The Predators:
- are initialised randomly in the environment and move in a semi-random manner to simulate a circuit movement in the torus plane.
- use energy as they move and hunt when energy level is low, although low levels do not prevent movement or hunting.
- search for grazers in a hunting neighbourhood specified by the user and attempt to hunt (eat them) to replenish energy. Predators will hunt when meeting conditions (grazer within neighbourhood and energy below 2) with a 0.2 probability of success and can only eat once per step.

## Program components
Running the model:
Execute the agentbasedmodel script to run the model. The first request for the user is to set the model parameters. This is done in the console and involves setting:

- Number of grazers
- Number of predators
- Number of iterations of the model
- Grazers sharing neighbourhood radio
- Predator hunting neighbourhood radio

When entered correctly, a GUI window will appear with several options in the Model menu (described delow). Running the model will display a visual representation of the environment with agents (sheep and wolves) intitialised in it, and an animation of their moving, grazing and hunting behaviours will start. Sheep will move randonmly within the 300x300 environment and eat, share and sick up a proportion of their eaten resources, based on the amount of resources eaten and position relative to other sheep. Wolves will move in a partially random circuit around the map and hunt for sheep when within hunting radius. Eaten sheep will dissapear from the environment and wolves will store hunting information. The length of time for the program to run will vary slightly depending on the initial randomised positions of the agents, but is mostly dependent on the number of iterations defined by the user (default number of iterations is 150). The model run will stop when:
- Simulation completes the number of iterations,
- Maximum grazing is achieved.

The program requires to scripts to run:
- [agentbasedmodel.py](https://sanluige.github.io/ABM/agentbasedmodel.py), which is the main script from which the program is executed, and;
- [agentframework.py](https://sanluige.github.io/ABM/agentframework.py), which is the definition of the Agent class and subclasses Grazer and Predator.

Additionally, it requires two files:
- [in.txt](https://sanluige.github.io/ABM/in.txt), which contains the environment information.
- [environmentout.csv](https://sanluige.github.io/ABM/environmentout.csv), which is the file used to write the environment data out of the model when requested by the user.

Please download the files into the same local directory to run.

**Please also refer the [README](https://sanluige.github.io/ABM/README) and [LICENSE](https://sanluige.github.io/ABM/LICENCE) files, which include the information in this page.**

## Navigating the model menu

The menu allows the user to:

**Run model**: Run the model with default parameters.

**Print agent information**: Prints the information of agents - grazers and predators - in the console.

**Print environment file**: Updates the environment state in an existing CSV file (provided above).

**Quit model**: Quits the execution of the model and closes model window.

## Code testing

The testing of the functionality of relevant methods and functions has been done using Doctests. Please run the doctests on the script agentframework.py for testing:
- Navigate to the directory where the script is located;
- run the command "python -m doctest -v agentframework.py" to initiate Doctests.

Some code used for testing and previous steps was commented out as additional proof of testing.

## Additional notes

- The code was developed to run on MacOS operating system, so users running the program in other operating systems should alter the code (particularly matplotlib commands) to run correctly in their computer.
